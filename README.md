# Time-To-Toast
Just Messing around with Toast Grid. Indeed it solved and helped me a lot understanding a concept that I wire framed it on a piece of beautiful paper. But the real problem started when I was unable to code and generate the design that I required. On one lucky day, at exact 30-12-2-16 (+UTC 14:20),Toast Grid came to rescue and I started hacking the concepts deeper and deeper.
